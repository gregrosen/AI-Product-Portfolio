# Airbnb NYC Listing Price Predictor

As GitHub has trouble displaying larger files, the best way to view this notebook is to use GitHub's HTML Previewer here: [Airbnb NYC 2019](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/gregrosen/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Airbnb_NYC_Rental_Price_Prediction/Airbnb_NYC_2019_Final-update1.html).
For best readability, I strongly suggest adjusting your browser's zoom to about 67%, as Jupyter Notebooks are naturally quite wide.



If you would like to view the full IPython notebook (not recommended: it is much longer), use Jupyter Notebook's nbviewer here: [Airbnb NYC 2019 Full Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gregrosen/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Airbnb_NYC_Rental_Price_Prediction/Airbnb_NYC_2019_Final-update1.ipynb).
