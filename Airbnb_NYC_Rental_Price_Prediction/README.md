## üîó How to View the Notebook

GitHub struggles to render large notebooks effectively. Here are two recommended ways to view this project:

1. **HTML Version (Recommended)**  
   View the interactive HTML version of the notebook here:  
   [Airbnb NYC 2019 HTML](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/gregrosen/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Airbnb_NYC_Rental_Price_Prediction/Airbnb_NYC_2019_Final.html)

   For optimal readability, adjust your browser's zoom to ~67% to account for the wide layout of Jupyter Notebooks.

2. **Jupyter Notebook Viewer**  
   Use nbviewer to view the notebook directly:
