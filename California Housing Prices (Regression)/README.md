## üîó Project Highlights

1. **Objective**:
   - Predict housing prices in California using demographic and geographical data.
   - Understand the most critical factors influencing housing prices.

2. **Data Source**:
   - California Housing Dataset (available from [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)).

3. **Key Techniques**:
   - Data Cleaning: Handling null values, outlier detection, and feature scaling.
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Correlation heatmaps and feature importance analysis.
   - Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost.

4. **Results Summary**:

The **XGBoost** model emerged as the best-performing regression model in this analysis. Here's what the results mean:

- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): 34.50**  
  This means that, on average, the predictions made by the model deviate from the actual housing prices by $34,500. This error is reasonably low given the range of housing prices in California.

- **R¬≤ (Coefficient of Determination): 0.72**  
  An R¬≤ score of 0.72 indicates that the model explains 72% of the variance in housing prices based on the features provided. In other words, the model successfully captures the majority of the factors influencing housing prices, making it a reliable tool for predictions.

These results demonstrate that the XGBoost model is both accurate and robust, making it suitable for real-world applications such as real estate pricing and market analysis.
