## Overview

This project explores the intersection of dating app preferences and political ideologies, leveraging data science to uncover insights about user behavior, preferences, and societal trends. The findings aim to contribute to a broader understanding of how political alignment influences digital interactions and matchmaking.

## Features
- **Data Processing and Cleaning:** Comprehensive preprocessing of raw data for accurate analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Detailed analysis of trends, patterns, and outliers in the dataset.
- **Statistical Analysis and Modeling:** Correlation studies and advanced modeling techniques to quantify relationships between variables.
- **Visualization:** Compelling visualizations to highlight key insights and make data more digestible.
- **Final Report:** An in-depth summary of methodologies, findings, and conclusions.

## Key Insights

- **Conservative Leaning Impact:** Female profiles on Hinge experienced a statistically significant decrease in match rate (-23 to -10 percentage points) when including a conservative-leaning statement, compared to profiles without any political leaning.
- **Liberal Leaning Effect:** Profiles with liberal-leaning statements did not show statistically significant changes in match rates across platforms or genders, though confidence intervals suggest potential variability depending on specific audience segments.
- **Gender Dynamics:** Women received significantly higher match rates compared to men across both platforms, highlighting gender-specific differences in user behavior.
- **Platform Differences:** Hinge, often viewed as a platform for serious relationships, showed more sensitivity to political treatment effects, whereas Tinder, a more casual platform, demonstrated less sensitivity, likely due to user behavior prioritizing visual over textual cues.
- **Political Homophily:** The study aligns with previous research, showing evidence of users preferring profiles with political ideologies similar to their own, but the effect was more pronounced for conservative treatments and for female profiles.
- **Algorithmic Effects and Bias:** Variability in match rates and user visibility suggests platform algorithms may influence user exposure, complicating the interpretation of treatment effects.
- **Statistical Challenges:** Conservative treatments on male profiles and all liberal treatments showed no statistically significant results, partially due to lower baseline match rates and insufficient data power for male profiles.
