SuperUseful! is an app helping users discover products in a refreshing and exciting new way. The experience combines endless scroll with online shopping to find useful products users might not even know they needed. Check out the demo at [SuperUsefulApp.com](https://superusefulapp.com)! (Please note this is a mobile-focused app, not optimized for desktop. Check it out on your smartphone!)

The app was designed using Figma, built using React with a Firebase database with Amazon Affiliate links to products.
