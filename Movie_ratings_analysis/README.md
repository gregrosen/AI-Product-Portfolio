This is the repository for Greg Rosen & Aruna Bisht's MIDS W200 Project 2, titled "Movie Ratings: Do They Matter?"

The project consists of a PDF proposal, a PDF report, a PDF presentation, and an IPYNB Jupyter Notebook with all code used.

The main dataset is included in this repo. The supplementary file, credits.csv, is too large to upload to Github. The link to the datasets on Kaggle is below to access the files:
